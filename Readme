Goal: data analysis of COVID-19 cases to obtain a rough picture of the confirmed case trajectory. 

Jimmy Mar 23: log_trend.py 

    Uses moving average of the growth rate as the progression indicator (we have to tune the average horizon to obtain update to date but not too erratic data.)

    Assumption: there are some constant multiple of confirmed cases running around infecting others, hence the geometric growth of the confirmed cases.

    Model: x(t) = \alpha^(k) * x(t-k) where k is the average horizon. 

    Drawbacks: ignores the fraction of people infected and the number of confirmed cases.
